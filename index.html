  <p class="title">Who I Am</p>
  <p>Hi, Good day, Im Calalang Neo Basa. I am student at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa, currently studying Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
I was born here on Muntinlupa City on July 21, 2002 and I am 21 years old now. I also live along with my parents here at Tunasan, Muntinlupa City. I have 2 siblings, brother and sister. I have a good relationship with my siblings and parents. Sometimes there is a little quarrel, but i think this is normal and we try to resolve our problems together.
My everyday activities included going to school, playing online games, volleyball, and watching some kdrama and anime. 
My expectations for this subject, Human Computer Interaction, are that i would be able to learn everything that is needed in this subject and that I would likewise be able to make use of them in the future. I expect that the quizzes, activities, and discussion wouldn’t be too hard and would be finished well.
In five years from today, I have no idea what will happen to me five years from now. But I assure my self I have a goal in mind and will fulfill that goal with passion and hard work. I can’t predict the future, but for me. I have to be goal oriented and should know what I want to achieve. </p>
